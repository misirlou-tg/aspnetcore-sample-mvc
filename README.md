# AspNetCore Sample MVC app

The source for the sample was copied from:
https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc/sample/8.0-completed

The instructions for the tutorial are here:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc

After populating this repo I realized that it requires a local SqlServer and I never continued on with this sample
